About expirer:
==============
expirer is a file expiry tool. It allows admin user to set expiry time for specific files and 
automagically removes them when it expires.

How to install:
============== 
see INSTALL file

How expirer works?
-----------------

When user sets file name and its time using 'expirer',time value recorded in file inode's dtime field.
Then the values filename,time,md5sum stored on  Berkeley DB (/etc/expirer/expirer.db) with time as key.
And restart the daemon process 'expirerd'.

expirerd is a daemon process which keeps reading DB file and when it finds entry which matches current
time, it compares the disk file owner,inode,md5sum with DB values. If there is a perfect match daemon
process unlinks the filepath and fetches the next DB record and repeats the process.

Why not use a simple scrit with cron ? 
---------------------------------------

Yes. You can achieve same effect with a simple bash/python scripts. One possible advantage(?) over 
such script is:

-    With bash/python scripts you need to store the file details at certain db. If there are 50 people 
     and each of them sets 1 file location and time to the db. Now db goes corrupt or missing. You need 
     to re-enter the value manually 50 times. With 'expirer' you can perform a simple rescan to re-create 
     the db entires,no need to manually set the file expiry time again!

Why you need such tool ?
-----------------------

- We have project where we(root) share files with users in a common directory. Just needed to ensure,that
  these files are deleted from common share once the user copies them to their home directories.

Why inode's dtime is used instead of acl?
----------------------------------------

acl can be used, If I'm not wrong sometimes(or always?) setting 'acl' entries consume 1 block. 
using dtime this can be prevented.

If you find some other field (may be i_ctime_extra ? ) which will be more useful or right place
holder than dtime. Please let me know. Thanks in advance!

Do you have an expirer GUI?
---------------------------

Glad you asked for it :D Yes!!!. We do have one based on Python-Kivy. Simply run 'expirer-gui' to use it.

How to use the tool
===================
 	
How to set expiry time for files?
---------------------------------

You need to pass devicename,absolute filepath and minutes as arguments to expirer binary.

Usage: expirer   [-l list] [-d devicename -f filepath -t minutes] [-s -d devicename -m mountpoint] [-c cancel -f filepath]

<code>
# expirer -d /dev/sda7 -f /home/laks/file.exp6 -t 10

 File /home/laks/file.exp6 will expire in 10 minutes : Sat Dec 21 12:38:17 2013
</code>

For example, above command ensure the file "/home/laks/file.exp6" expires in 10 minutes
which happens to be "Sat Dec 21 12:38:17 2013".

How to view list of expiry files and it details?
-----------------------------------------------
<code>
# expirer -l

	Filename	      Expires on

	--------	      ----------

	/home/laks/file.exp6	Sat Dec 21 12:38:17 2013	

	/home/laks/file.exp10	Sat Dec 21 19:15:39 2013
</code>
How to Cancel an entry from the expiry job list?
------------------------------------------------
Suppose, your mind changed, now you won't want the file (file.exp10) to get expired. In order to cancel the previously
applied expiry settings run the following command:
<code>
# expirer -c -f /home/laks/file.exp10
</code>
How to scan a device for expiry files ?
--------------------------------------

If you want to recreate the database use -s option rescan the partition.
<code>
# expirer -s -d devicename -m mounteddir
</code>

example:
<code>
#expirer -s -d /dev/sda7 -m /home
</code>

Will scan the drive /dev/sda7 which was mounted on /home directory.

Note: Run this command only when /etc/expirer/info.db is corrupt or accidentally 
removed.
