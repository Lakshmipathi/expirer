expirer TODO list
-----------------
- Use other field instead of inode's  i_dtime ?
- expirer on symlink sets dtime on target file not symlink itself - fix needed ?
- Accept input for specific set of file types. (ex: expire all *.txt for uid=500)
- Improve rescan option (-s) without -m option
- Replace expirerd daemon with python code.
- Handle UI errors from python-kivy


---
Known Issues
============
- fsck will report error and ask you to fix dtime for these expiring files.

- If file.txt initially set to be expired at 10.03am then user changed his/her mind
  trying to adjust the file to be expired at 11.44am - May still expire at 10.03am
  -> Need time to think about this. What to do? Lets add this on Version 0.2 :p
