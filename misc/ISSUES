Known Issues
============
- fsck will report error and ask you to fix dtime for these expiring files.
  expirer sets inode structures dtime - while the inode is in-use.

- If file.txt initially set to be expired at 10.03am then user changed his/her mind
  trying to adjust the file to be expired at 11.44am - May still expire at 10.03am
  -> Need time to think about this. What to do? Lets add this on Version 0.2 :p
